```bash
	### Set $IP variable to the assigned IP Address
	export IP=10.10.175.83
```

# Reconnaissance
```bash
	### Run nmap to gather the target's information
	nmap -A -Pn $IP >> $IP-nmap-scan
```

From the nmap scan, I see port 80 is open:

![web-server](./Images/web-server.png)

Also from the nmap result, I found some potential directories to exploit and figured that the web server is using Joomla.

Doing some Googling, I found a way to find Joomla version by accessing the following url:
_http://www.[thejoomlawebsite].com/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml_

Also from this link, I was able to find a lot of directories for possible exploits. Joomla version can also be found in README.md


# Exploit
I found a vulnerability related to Joomla 3.7.0 [CVE-2017-8917]("https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42033")
Using a python script from [HarryR's github]("https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/Joomblah"), I was able to retrived the login credentials for the CMS.

```bash
	python3 joomlah.py http://$IP
```

Found a user "jonah" with a hash password, which uses bcrypt algorithm. Use John to crack this hash:

```bash
	john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=bcrypt
```

![crackl-hash-password](./Images/crack-hash-password.png)

We're now able to log into Joomla admin as jonah

Following instruction on this article, I was able to gain a reverse shell on the machine. Running linpeas.sh on the target machine, I found a password in config file:

![user-password](./Images/user-password.png)

Using this password, we're able to SSH to the target machine under jjameson.
A simple command ```sudo -l```, we found jjameson can run yum. Refering to [GTFOBins]("https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/yum/"), i was able to escalate to root.
